# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Create another animation

1) Choose the proper file (the one that is more related to the animation goal)
2) Add the function call on `methodObject` in `canvas.js`
3) Add the route on `routes.js`
4) Reload server so routes can be added on webpack
